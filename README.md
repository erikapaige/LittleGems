# LittleGems

Apps like Yelp, Google, Uber Eats, and Door Dash have revolutionized the way we explore restaurants. These apps provide endless options for food eateries based on the reviews and ratings for each location. The greater the reviews and ratings, the higher the business is ranked and the more it is recommended to users. However, what happens to the restaurants with few reviews? The ones that have spectacular food and service, but only a small sample of people who know about it? Many times, they are overlooked and therefore, not ranked as highly on recommendations. Little Gems shines a spotlight on these places by providing users with recommendations of local 4-star rated restaurants which have a small number of reviews. 

## APIs

- ‘Zomato’ provides restaurant details: name, ratings, location, photo website, and reviews. 
- Browser geolocation API identifies an IP address based on location services, providing GPS coordinates of the user’s position.
- ‘Google Maps’ creates an interactive map based on the user’s determined location. This is a free service for small applications (larger and more popular applications need a paid tier). However, Google Maps gives all developers a monthly $200 credit.

## STYLING LIBRARIES

- ‘Materialize’ is the primary styling library; Little Gems is built on Materialize's 12-grid system.
- ‘Fonts.googleapis.com' is a styling library that supplements the Materialize icons. It is found in the ‘head’ of the document.
